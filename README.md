## :notes: Introduction

### What are the uniques?

This specific project was started with our previous two demos, [all-in-one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xdecoder/Demo) and [instruct x-decoder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xdecoder/Instruct-X-Decoder). Then we were inspired by [visual-chatgpt](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt) developed by our MSRA collegues to use the [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to empower a conversational X-Decoder and encompassing all the capacities of our single X-Decoder model.

Our **X-GPT** has several unique and new features:

* **It uses a SINGLE X-Decoder model to support a wide range of vision and vision-language tasks. As such, you do not need separate models for individual tasks!**

* **It delivers the state-of-the-art segmentation performance. It is much better than CLIPSeg or other existing open-vocabulary segmentation systems!**

* **It also supports text-to-image retrieval. You can choose find a real image from your own pool or ask for generating a new image!**

In the next, we will:

* **You may notice we developed a more grounded instructPix2Pix with the support of our X-Decoder. Next we integrate it to our X-GPT!**

## Getting Started

### Installation
```sh
# set up environment
conda create -n xgpt python=3.8
conda activate xgpt

# install dependencies
pip3 install torch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/MaureenZOU/detectron2-xyz.git'
pip install git+https://github.com/cocodataset/panopticapi.git
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
sh install_cococapeval.sh

# download x-decoder tiny model
wget https://projects4jw.blob.core.windows.net/x-decoder/release/xdecoder_focalt_last_novg.pt
wget https://projects4jw.blob.core.windows.net/x-decoder/release/xdecoder_focalt_vqa.pt

# create a folder for image uploading and image retrieval, note image_folder is for image retrieval, image is for cache
mkdir image & mkdir image_pool

# export openai key, please follow https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/llms/integrations/azure_openai_example.html
export OPENAI_API_TYPE=azure
export OPENAI_API_VERSION=2022-12-01
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>

```

## Run Demo
```sh
# Simply run this single line and enjoy it!!!
python xgpt.py
```

## Acknowledgement

We are highly inspired by [visual-chatgpt](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt) in the usage of langchain, and build on top of many great open-sourced projects: [HuggingFace Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), [InstructPix2Pix](https://github.com/timothybrooks/instruct-pix2pix).
